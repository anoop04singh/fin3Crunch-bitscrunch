## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components & Workflow

The application's architecture is designed for security, performance, and intelligence. It separates the frontend presentation from the data fetching and AI logic.

### 1. The `fin3Crunch AI` Agent (The Brains)

The heart of the application is the conversational AI agent, which understands user queries and fetches the precise data needed to answer them.

-   **Technology:** The agent is powered by **Google Gemini**, accessed via the Vercel AI SDK in the `/api/chat` route.

-   **Core Mechanism: Function Calling:** The AI's true power lies in its ability to use "tools" (functions). Instead of just generating text, Gemini can analyze a user's prompt and decide to call a specific function to get live data from the BitsCrunch API. This ensures answers are accurate and up-to-date.

-   **The Tools:** The AI has three primary tools at its disposal:
    1.  `queryNFTData`: Used for simple, direct questions about a single metric (e.g., "what's the floor price?", "get me the metadata"). It calls a single, specific BitsCrunch endpoint.
    2.  `getCollectionOverview`: This is the power tool, used for broad, complex requests (e.g., "give me a full analysis of a collection," "is this NFT a good buy?"). It makes multiple, parallel API calls to BitsCrunch to gather a complete picture (metadata, analytics, scores, whale data, price estimates) and then presents it in a structured `ReportCard` component.
    3.  `getWalletOverview`: A powerful tool for analyzing a specific wallet address. It fetches NFT and token holdings, wallet score, and key metrics to provide a complete financial picture, presented in a dedicated `WalletReportCard`.

-   **The Process:**
    1.  A user sends a message (e.g., "Tell me about BAYC #8817").
    2.  The query, along with chat history and a detailed system prompt, is sent to the `/api/chat` route.
    3.  Gemini analyzes the query and determines that the `getCollectionOverview` tool is needed with the appropriate `contract_address` and `token_id`.
    4.  The backend executes this function, which makes several calls to our secure `/api/bitscrunch` proxy.
    5.  The structured data from BitsCrunch is returned to the Gemini model.
    6.  Gemini uses this data to formulate a human-readable summary and selects the appropriate UI components (like `ReportCard`, `MetricsCard`, `LineChartCard`) to visually represent the information.

### 2. Detailed Reports Page

This page allows users to conduct their own deep-dive analysis without using the chat interface.

-   **User Input:** The user provides a collection's contract address and an optional token ID.
-   **Backend Process:** When the "Generate" button is clicked, the frontend triggers a series of parallel API calls to the `/api/bitscrunch` proxy. It fetches data from multiple endpoints, including `/nft/collection/metadata`, `/nft/collection/analytics`, `/nft/collection/scores`, and `/nft/collection/whales`.
-   **AI Enhancement:** After the data is fetched and displayed, the user can click **"Generate AI Summary"**. This sends all the collected report data to the `/api/gemini` route with a specific prompt, instructing the AI to act as a financial analyst and produce a concise, expert summary of the findings.

### 3. Wall of Shame

This feature is designed to bring transparency to the NFT market by highlighting suspicious activity.

-   **Purpose:** To identify and display collections and individual NFTs with high levels of wash trading.
-   **Mechanism:** On page load, this component fetches data directly from the BitsCrunch `/nft/collection/washtrade` and `/nft/washtrade` endpoints, sorted by the highest volume of suspicious activity.
-   **Interactivity:** Users can click on any listed item to open a detailed modal view, which shows specific wash trading metrics and 24-hour trend charts, providing deeper insight into the manipulation patterns.

### 4. The Secure API Gateway (`/api/bitscrunch`)

This is the single, secure gateway for all external Web3 data requests.

-   **Security First:** This architecture is a critical security feature. The frontend **never** calls the BitsCrunch API directly, and the `BITSCRUNCH_API_KEY` is never exposed in the browser.
-   **How it Works:**
    1.  The frontend (or the AI agent's tool-calling function) sends a request to our internal `/api/bitscrunch` route.
    2.  The server-side code in this route receives the request, securely attaches the `BITSCRUNCH_API_KEY` from the server's environment variables.
    3.  It then forwards the complete, authorized request to the actual BitsCrunch API.
    4.  The response from BitsCrunch is routed back through the proxy to the client.
