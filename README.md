## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application's architecture is designed for security, performance, and intelligence. It separates the frontend presentation from the data fetching and AI logic.

1.  **Frontend (Next.js/React):** The user interacts with the client-side application. When a user connects their wallet or requests a report, the frontend sends a request to our internal Next.js API routes.

2.  **Backend Proxy (`/api/bitscrunch`):** This is the secure gateway for all Web3 data.
    -   The frontend **never** calls the BitsCrunch API directly.
    -   It sends a request to this proxy route with the desired endpoint and parameters.
    -   The server-side route securely attaches the `BITSCRUNCH_API_KEY` from environment variables and forwards the request to the BitsCrunch API.
    -   This prevents the API key from ever being exposed in the browser.

3.  **AI Chat Logic (`/api/chat`):** This is the brain of the application.
    -   When a user sends a message, the entire chat history is sent to this endpoint.
    -   The endpoint uses the **Google Gemini** model, which has been provided with a detailed system prompt and two powerful "tools" (functions) it can call: `getCollectionOverview` and `queryNFTData`.
    -   **Function Calling:** Gemini analyzes the user's prompt and decides which tool, if any, is needed to answer the question. It determines the necessary parameters (e.g., contract address, token ID).
    -   **Tool Execution:** The backend executes the function chosen by the AI. This function then calls our `/api/bitscrunch` proxy to fetch the required data.
    -   **Response Generation:** The data from the BitsCrunch API is returned to the Gemini model. The model then uses this data to formulate a final, human-readable answer, which is sent back to the user.

### Key BitsCrunch API Endpoints Used

The AI agent is empowered to use a wide range of BitsCrunch endpoints. Here are some of the key ones:

-   **Wallet Analytics:**
    -   `/wallet/balance/nft`: To fetch all NFT holdings for a connected wallet.
    -   `/wallet/balance/token`: To fetch all ERC20 token holdings.
    -   `/wallet/score`: To calculate a wallet's risk and activity score.
-   **NFT & Collection Data:**
    -   `/nft/metadata` & `/nft/collection/metadata`: For basic information and images.
    -   `/nft/collection/analytics`: For market data like volume, sales, and floor price.
    -   `/nft/collection/scores`: For metrics like market cap and average price.
    -   `/nft/collection/whales`: To identify large holders in a collection.
    -   `/nft/liquify/price_estimate`: For AI-powered price predictions for specific NFTs.
-   **Market Intelligence:**
    -   `/nft/market-insights/analytics`: For a high-level overview of the entire NFT market.
    -   `/nft/top_deals`: To find potentially undervalued NFTs.
-   **Security & Transparency:**
    -   `/nft/washtrade` & `/nft/collection/washtrade`: To power the "Wall of Shame" by identifying suspicious trading activity.
